Developer Challenge

Design and implement a system that will accept a multipart form upload (say, containing an audio file) while displaying a percentage progress.

The basic HTML design should look like:

* Display form with file input field
* Display a title text field
* Display a status text paragraph "select file"
* Optionally display a submit button

* Specification:
* When the user picks a file from their computer and optionally presses the submit button, the upload begins.
* While uploading, the status text paragraph should be updating with the current percentage complete at least once every 2 seconds.
* While uploading, the user should be able to enter text into the title text field.
* When the upload completes, the status text should display the path on the server to the saved file.

Requirements:

* The upload should honor proxy settings on the browser
* The system must function behind a firewall that blocks all but port 80
* The server must support at least 2 concurrent uploads
* Any technology that can be web deployed to IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome on any platform is supported


Further Requirements:
* No Flash (yik!!)
* Rails
* jQuery
* Paperclip

more lightweight: sinatra??

* No extra module
